# CPU Monitor Text

![Sample screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This is a fork of the original [CPU Monitor Text](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/tree/master/cpu-monitor-text@gnemonix) applet.

It removes the padding with spaces from the CPU usage percent.

## Installation

Clone or download (green Code button > Download ZIP, then unzip) into the following directory in your system:

```
~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/cpu-monitor-text
```

Then logout and login again to enable the extension. Alternatively, you can hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd>, then type `r` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to reload Cinnamon.
